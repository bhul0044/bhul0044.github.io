            <h1> About me </h1>
            <p>
                My name is Ashnoor Kaur Bhullar. I hail from Haryana (India). I am 19 years old.
                As for my interest in studying,<br> I find coding interesting and easy because 
                there is nothing we need to understand we just have to memorize it.</br>
                In school, we were not introduced to coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                I begin my journey in coding by watching videos from YouTube. 
                That'show my interest to go on with interactive media design began. <br>
                As for my hobbies, I really do not have any because I get bored with things very easily.
                But I was good at racing in high school, and achieved 1<sup>st</sup> palce in
                <abbr title="district level">competition.</abbr></br>
                
            </p>

                 I can do everything" </em>
